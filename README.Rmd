# Dendro_R

A small repository that lists R packages used in dendrochronology or tree-ring research. This overview might not be complete, and if you miss anything, please add these or contact me.

Go to the [Dendro_R web-pages](https://ronaldvisser.github.io/Dendro_R/) to learn more about R packages in dendrochronology.
