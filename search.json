This overview of R-packages might not be complete, and if you miss anything, please add these using a pull request in Github or contact me.\nIf you want to start with R, there are several options:\n\nOpenDendro is a great resource for those who want to learn about dplR (or dplPy). There are some wonderful tutorials.\nSoftware Carpentry is for teaching basic lab skills for research computing and is good for beginners.\nData carpentry helps you to gain foundational skills needed to work effectively and reproducibly with data and code.\nR for Data Science (2e) is an extensive and accessible book on general R and doing data science using R.\nCTV-Archaeology is a more general list maintained by Ben Marwick on possibilities and libraries in R, mostly aimed at Archaeology.\n\nI would recommend working with an IDE such as RStudio and always use projects in your workflow!"
